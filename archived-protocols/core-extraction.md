# DNA Extraction - MagMAX CORE Kit

## Theory

## Prepare Your Workspace

- [ ] Turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet. This is done by lifting the sash to operating sash height, marked on the left side of the hood. This should turn on the blower, white light, and window alarm. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol, including the work surface, walls, and glass.
- [ ] Lower the sash and press the UV button. This will turn on the UV light for 15 minutes. It will turn off automatically. 

⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*
