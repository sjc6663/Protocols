# 16S Processing with dada2

## Theory
This is a basic protocol for 16S sequencing processing from raw files to ASV tables. This is for beginning/new lab members to familiarize with the 16S bioinformatics pipeline. This pipeline is only applicable to 16S sequencing data. This protocol includes mostly code and is designed as a reference and not a stand-alone tutorial.
