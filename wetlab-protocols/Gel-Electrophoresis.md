# Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

## Theory
After performing 16S PCR, one of the best ways to determine success of the reaction is to run your amplicons through a gel in gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis separates out your samples based on size (number of base pairs). This can be compared to a known ladder to determine the sizing of your amplicons and make sure they are correct.
